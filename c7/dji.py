    """Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    source : node label
       Starting node for path

    get_weight: function
        Function for getting edge weight

    pred: list, optional(default=None)
        List of predecessors of a node

    paths: dict, optional (default=None)
        Path from the source to a target node.

    target : node label, optional
       Ending node for path

    cutoff : integer or float, optional
       Depth to stop the search. Only paths of length <= cutoff are returned.

    Returns
    -------
    distance,path : dictionaries
       Returns a tuple of two dictionaries keyed by node.
       The first dictionary stores distance from the source.
       The second stores the path from the source to that node.

    pred,distance : dictionaries
       Returns two dictionaries representing a list of predecessors
       of a node and the distance to each node.

    distance : dictionary
       Dictionary of shortest lengths keyed by target.
